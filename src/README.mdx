> Alice Design System -  A ReactJS Component Library for your next Projects.

## Get Started

To start your own React component library, clone this repository and start your own Git journey!

```bash
$ npm install
$ cd cool-name
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init
```

## Development and Storybook

You can easily develop and interact with your components by using Storybook. To run the local server, simply run:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run storybook
```
Navigate to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) to view your stories. They should automatically update as you develop.

Storybook will pick up any story from the `stories.js` file in a component folder.

Rinse is currently using the latest technology available, so you may need to update your Node versions to latest to accomodate Babel 7 and Webpack 4.
